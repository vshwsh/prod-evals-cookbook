## Current Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Price | Target Customer | Key Features |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Individuals, small teams trying us | 3 projects, 10 users max, basic features |
| **Starter** | $12/user/mo | Small teams (5-20) | Unlimited projects, integrations, 10GB storage |

All paid plans billed annually receive a **20% discount** (Starter: $10/user/mo, Pro: $16/user/mo).

## Pricing Philosophy

1. **Value-based pricing:** Price reflects value delivered, not cost to serve
2. **Land and expand:** Easy to start, natural upgrade triggers
3. **Per-seat model:** Aligns with how customers think about software costs
4. **No feature hostage:** Core functionality available at all tiers

## Discount Policy

### Standard Discounts
| Discount Type | Amount | Approval |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| Annual billing | 20% | Automatic |
| 2-year contract | 30% | Sales Manager |
| 3-year contract | 35% | Sales Director |
| Non-profit | 50% | Sales Manager |
| Education | 50% | Sales Manager |
| Startup (<$5M raised) | 25% | Sales Manager |

### Non-Standard Discounts
Any discount beyond the standard matrix requires:
- Written justification
- VP Sales or CRO approval
- Finance review for deals >$50K ARR

**We do not offer discounts for:**
- Competitors switching (creates wrong incentive)
- "Just because" - every discount needs a reason
- Short-term promotional pricing

## Upgrade Triggers

### Free → Starter
- Hitting project limit (3)
- Hitting user limit (10)
- Need integrations (Slack, GitHub, etc.)

### Starter → Professional
- Need advanced reporting
- Want workflow automations
- Hitting storage limits
- Growing team size (economics favor Pro at ~30 users)

### Professional → Enterprise
- SSO requirement
- Audit log requirement
- Custom contract terms
- Dedicated support needs
- Advanced security features

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Price | Our Advantage |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Monday.com | $12-24/user/mo | Better UX, AI features |
| Asana | $11-25/user/mo | More flexible, better integrations |
| Notion | $10-18/user/mo | Purpose-built for PM, not docs |
| Jira | $8-17/user/mo | Easier to use, faster setup |

**Key differentiator for 2025:** AI-powered features not available in competitors.
