# Product Roadmap 2025

**Last Updated:** January 10, 2025  
**Owner:** Product Team

## Vision

In 2025, Acme Projects becomes the **intelligent project management platform** - not just a place to track tasks, but an AI-powered assistant that helps teams work smarter.

## Annual Themes

### Q1: Foundation for AI
- Launch AI infrastructure and data pipelines
- Release AI-powered search across all content
- Beta: Smart task suggestions

### Q2: Automation Everywhere
- Workflow automation builder (no-code)
- AI-generated status updates
- Smart notifications that reduce noise

### Q3: Enterprise Scale
- Advanced permissions and audit logs
- SSO group sync (auto-provisioning)
- Custom fields and workflows for enterprise

### Q4: Intelligence Layer
- Predictive project health scores
- AI meeting assistant integration
- Cross-project insights and recommendations

## Q1 2025 Initiatives (Current)

### 🎯 AI-Powered Search
**Status:** In Development  
**Target:** February 2025

Natural language search across all project content. Ask questions like:
- "What did we decide about the pricing change?"
- "Show me all tasks related to the mobile app launch"
- "Find discussions about API rate limiting"

### 🎯 Smart Task Suggestions (Beta)
**Status:** Design Complete  
**Target:** March 2025

AI suggests:
- Task assignees based on past work
- Due dates based on similar tasks
- Related tasks that might be dependencies

### 🎯 Performance Improvements
**Status:** In Progress  
**Target:** January 2025

- 50% reduction in page load times
- Mobile app offline mode improvements
- Fix iOS crash issue with large projects

## Q2 2025 Initiatives (Planned)

### 🔮 Workflow Automation Builder
Let users create automations without code:
- "When a task is marked done, notify the project owner"
- "When a due date passes, escalate to manager"
- "When all subtasks complete, mark parent complete"

### 🔮 AI Status Updates
Generate weekly status updates from project activity:
- What was completed
- What's in progress
- What's at risk

### 🔮 Smart Notifications
Reduce notification overload:
- AI-prioritized notification digest
- Quiet hours that actually work
- "Important" badge for things that need attention

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Q4 2025 Target |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| DAU | 45,000 | 75,000 |
| NPS | 42 | 55 |
| AI Feature Adoption | 0% | 40% |
| Enterprise Customers | 85 | 150 |
| Mobile DAU | 12,000 | 25,000 |

## Dependencies & Risks

### Technical Dependencies
- AI infrastructure must be complete before Q1 features
- Mobile performance fix needed before offline improvements
- SSO group sync requires identity provider partnerships

### Risks
- **AI quality:** If suggestions aren't good, adoption will suffer
- **Enterprise timeline:** SSO group sync has complex edge cases
- **Mobile team capacity:** Small team with large backlog
