# Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024  
**Last Updated:** February 1, 2024  
**Policy Owner:** People Operations

## Overview

Acme Corp offers a **flexible PTO policy** that trusts employees to take the time they need to rest, recharge, and handle personal matters. We believe well-rested employees do their best work.

## PTO Guidelines

### Recommended Minimum
We recommend all employees take at least **4 weeks (20 business days)** of PTO per year. This is a minimum, not a maximum.

### No Accrual or Rollover
PTO does not accrue and there is no payout upon departure. Take time when you need it.

### Approval Process
1. Request time off in Workday at least **2 weeks in advance** for planned vacations
2. Your manager will approve or discuss timing conflicts within 48 hours
3. For emergencies or illness, notify your manager as soon as possible

## Sick Leave

Sick leave is **unlimited and separate from PTO**. Use it when:
- You're physically ill
- You have a medical appointment
- You need a mental health day
- You're caring for a sick family member

No doctor's note required for absences under 5 consecutive days.

## Company Holidays

Acme Corp observes **12 paid holidays** per year:

| Holiday | 2025 Date |
|---------|-----------|
| New Year's Day | January 1 |
| MLK Jr. Day | January 20 |

## Blackout Periods

There are no company-wide blackout periods. However, some teams may have critical periods (e.g., end of quarter for Sales) where PTO should be coordinated carefully with your manager.

## Extended Leave

For leaves longer than 3 weeks, please work with your manager and HR to ensure proper coverage and handoff of responsibilities.
